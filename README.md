# Exercises from CS 2110
These object-oriented programming &amp; data structures exercises were done during the summer of 2018 to familiarize me with classes, data structures and Java. The original assignments are from the fall 2017 course website of Cornell CS 2110, taught by Professors David Gries, Adrian Sampson and Eleanor Birrell.
